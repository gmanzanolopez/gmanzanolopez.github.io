# Password Generator Homework
  
    I tried to  create an application that generates a password depending on the criteria the user selects. The page displays a series of questions with the criteria that you are able to choose from.

# Generate password button
  When you first click on the button that says generate password it will prompt 
  you to a series of questions in order to be able to generate you a proper password.

# Password Generator Questions 
  * First it will ask you for the length of the password, which you get to choose
  from 8 to 25 characters.
  * Second it will ask if you want to add lower case letters to your password 
  * Third it will ask if you want upper case letters.
  * Fourth it will ask if you also want numbers.
  * Last it will ask if you also want special characters in your passowrd.
 This should be able to generate you an accurate password with the different 
 criteria you choosed. 

# Password Generating Process
  I did all my javascript as cleaned as I could I was unable to make the special 
  characters, upper and lower case letters to work. The length of password was accurate and numbers, other than that I tried my best to figure out how to make the other characters work.
